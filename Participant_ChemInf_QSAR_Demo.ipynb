Meaning that a large value indicates more potency (because the effective mescaline dose is divided by a smaller value). Of course some studies use binding values for 5HT-2A receptors rather than effective hallucinogenic doses but this seems like more fun."

The reality is that data curation and question formulation are 90% of the work and the modelling is the fun part! There are many ways to represent molecules (different fingerprints, chemcial descriptors, DFT parameters) and many ways to represent the mathematical relationships between structure and activity, and finally, many ways to test the predictive capability of a new model. What we have learned, however, is how powerful cloud-based resources can be used for demonstrating and sharing computing techniques and we have learned a few nice Python tricks for cheminformatic analysis."
